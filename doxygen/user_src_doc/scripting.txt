\par NOTE
	All commands listed above are available to Program Level Scripts (PLS).
	&dagger; and &Dagger; referenced commands are used for Queue Level
	Scripts (QLS).

\section script_commands Script Command Format

COMMAND:<br>
COMMAND:<parameter><br>
COMMAND:<parameter>,<parameter><br>

The command and parameters are separated by a colon ':'.

Parameters are single or multiple word(s). If multiple words are used and
contain spaces or commas the text must be enclosed in quotes. Each parameter
is delimited by a comma.

\par Example:

This tag is used to identify the file as a FLAMP script file. This must be
located on the first line. If this is not present, the script will not
execute.<br>
<tt>\ref ss_file_id "FLAMP_CONFIG"</tt><br>
<br>

A command without parameters <br>
<tt>\ref ss_clear_tx_queue "CLEAR TXQ":</tt><br>
<br>

This command has spaces in it's parameter list, requiring quotes.<br>
<tt>\ref ss_path_directory "PATH":"/directory path"</tt><br>
<br>

This command has both commas and spaces in it's parameter list,
requiring quotes.<br>
<tt>\ref ss_file_desc "FILE":"weather_report.txt", "Report, Weekly Weather"</tt><br>
<br>

All parameter can be enclosed in quotes.<br>
<tt>\ref ss_call_to "CALLTO":"WX"</tt><br>
<tt>\ref ss_file_desc "FILE":"weather_report.txt", "Weekly Weather Report"</tt><br>
<br>

\section script_class_types Script Class Types

There are two classes of script files, 'Program Level Script (PLS)' and the
'Queue Level Script (QLS)'. The 'Program' and 'Queue' level scripts can be
executed from the 'Script'->'Execute Config Script' menu item.
'Program Level' scripts are responsible for configuring parameters of
the program. All commands are available, See \ref s_list_of_commands.

\image latex menu_script_execution.png "Executing PL Scripts" width=2.63in
\image html menu_script_execution.png "Executing PL Scripts"

The 'Queue Level Scripts (QLS)' uses a subset of commands listed here
\(\ref s_list_of_commands\) and marked with &dagger; or &Dagger; Notes. This
file is placed and executed in the event->timed panel.

\image latex event_queue_path_script.png "Executing QL Scripts" width=4.85in
\image html event_queue_path_script.png "Executing QL Scripts"

Both class files can be executed in either location. However, if a PL script
is executed in the event timed panel, warnings/errors will be issued
in the debug log.

Some commands are used to modify the attributes of a queued file. In order to
set these attribues the commands noted with &Dagger; should be called prior
to issuing the \ref ss_file_desc "FILE" command. See \ref s_list_of_commands.

Script files are expected to have the .txt file extension.

\section s_os_differences Operating System Script Differences

The following commands have specific parameter difference for each of the
three operations systems.
<br>

\ref ss_path_directory "PATH", \ref ss_file_desc "FILE", and
\ref ss_queue_filepath "QUEUE FILEPATH".

\ref ss_path_directory "PATH" Parameter:
<ul>
	<li><b>Linux</b>:<br> The path structure for accessing directories
	are<br>
	/Root_Drive/Directory/Directory/,...</li>
	<li><b>Macintosh</b>:<br> Has a case insensitive file system (unless the
	disk drive is formated for a case sensitive access).  The path
	structure for accessing directories are<br>
	/Root_Drive/Directory/Directory/,...</li>
	<li><b>Windows</b>: The primary difference is the use of a disk drive
	letter and a backslash path separator in place of a fore-slash.<br>
	Example: C:\\Directory\\Directory\\,...<br>
	However, the Win32 Cross Compiler used to create the executable
	performs translations if the fore-slash is used.<br>
	Example: C:/Directory/Directory/,...<br>
	Produces the same results.</li>
</ul>

<br>
\ref ss_file_desc "FILE" Parameter:

The file name must contain filename.ext format with no
\ref ss_path_directory "PATH" data. Depending on OS case sensitivity might
apply. By having the \ref ss_path_directory "PATH" as a separate entry.
Porting scripts to the other OS's is easier to maintain.

\ref ss_queue_filepath "QUEUE FILEPATH" Parameter:

Since this is a single entry the path and filename are combined into one
parameter. The format rules are specified above.
<br>
<br>

\section s_script_execution Script Execution

To execute a configure script. Select 'Script'->'Execute Script' menu
item. This is bring up a open file dialog box allowing for navigating to the
desired script file. Select the file in question and press the open button.
This executes the script file. See \ref s_error_reporting "Error Reporting"
in the event of errors.

'Script'->'Execute Script (FLAMP Dir)' menu item reset the initial directory
path back to the default starting location.

\section s_error_reporting Script Error Reporting

If errors are found at the completion of script parsing. This dialog box
will be displayed.

\image latex script_error_dialog_box.png "Script Error Dialog Box" width=4.2in
\image html script_error_dialog_box.png "Script Error Dialog Box"

For a detailed review, open the debug log under the 'Help' menu.  This example
indicates the path to the files was not found. This
\ref ss_path_directory "PATH" error is responsible for the
\ref ss_file_desc "FILE" errors.

\image latex script_errors_debug_log.png "Debug Log Script Error(s)" width=5.5in
\image html script_errors_debug_log.png "Debug Log Script Error(s)"

The information in the debug log provides a line number of where the error
occurred. Take note of this when making corrections to the script file.

\par NOTE:
	Although errors have occurred, all commands that are syntax correct have
	been processed and the appropriate settings applied.
